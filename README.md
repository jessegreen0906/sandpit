# Jesse's Sandpit

This repo is for storing any fragments of code that I'm just playing around with. As such, nothing in this repository should be used for real world projects. I make no promises to update or provide support for anything in this project.

Anything in this repo is considered by me to be public domain. You may copy-paste, reference, reuse, etc. freely. I'd love it if you sent a shout out my way though.

Go forth and make cool stuff.
